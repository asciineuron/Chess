-chess game program
       -not AI of any sort, but terminal representation of board, allowing two users to play a game of chess
       -experimentation with classes: create chesspiece class, rook, knight, etc. subclasses, define moves for each
       -represent chessboard with array, define allowed moves in terms of change in array position
       -game done when king dead


IDEAS:
	*use command structure "queen to E5" or "PIECE TO LOCATION"
	*if more than one of a given piece exist, ask to type in location of desired piece
